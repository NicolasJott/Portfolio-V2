  description: `I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at InsureScope, where I get to dive into the latest AI technologies and build some pretty exciting stuff for the insurance world. I just finished up my Computer Science degree at Youngstown State University, and honestly, I'm loving every minute of this journey. I've always been passionate about building web apps and now AI-powered solutions too - there's something incredibly satisfying about seeing your code come to life and actually help people. Growing up, my dad (who's a full stack engineer) was always working on these amazing projects, and watching him sparked my love for software engineering. Now I'm getting to explore the wild world of AI and machine learning, and it feels like I'm just getting started!`,
